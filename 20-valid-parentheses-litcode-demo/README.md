<summary>📄 Problem Statement</summary>

Given a string `s` containing just parentheses characters, determine if the input string is valid. Open brackets must be closed by the same type and in the correct order.

</details>

## 💡 Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        pairs = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}

        for char in s:
            if char in pairs.values():
                stack.append(char)
            elif not stack or stack.pop() != pairs[char]:
                return False

        return not stack
```
